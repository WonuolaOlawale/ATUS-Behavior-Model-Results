# ATUS DF Behavior Model Results
## Repo Contents
The Stata codes I wrote to run the econometric analysis in the corresponding study is committed to this repo as "ATUS2_Stata.do". <br/>
Appendix A presents the choice model results in .html format; daytypechmodels.html, periodschmodels.html, and timescalechmodels.html. <br/>
Appendix B presents the duration model results in .html format; durcripeakslide.html, durdayslide.html, durinstslide.html, duroffpeakslide.html, durpeakslide.html, durperiodslide.html, durwkdayslide.html, and durwkndslide.html.<br/>

periodschmodels.html: The critical peak, peak, and off-peak choice estimates.<br/>
timescalechmodels.html: The single instance, any period, and any day choice estimates.<br/>

durdayslide.html: The duration estimates for any day.<br/>
